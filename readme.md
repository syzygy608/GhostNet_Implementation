# GhostNet Implementation in PyTorch

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of GhostNet, a lightweight convolutional neural network designed for efficient mobile vision applications. GhostNet introduces the concept of "ghost modules" to generate more feature maps from cheap operations, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining performance.
